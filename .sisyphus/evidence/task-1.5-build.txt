# Build Verification - Task 1.5
Date: 2026-02-16

## Build Command
`npm run build`

## Result: FAILED

## Error
```
[ERROR] [vite] ✗ Build failed in 2.46s
Could not resolve "../../../convex/_generated/api" from "src/components/forms/LeadForm.tsx"
file: C:/Users/56930/OneDrive/Escritorio/guardman/src/components/forms/LeadForm.tsx
```

## Warnings (non-blocking but noted)
1. Content collections auto-generated (deprecated) - should define in src/content.config.ts
2. No files found in content/blog and content/locations
3. Multiple getStaticPaths() ignored warnings in dynamic pages (need `export const prerender = true`)

## dist/ Directory Status
- EXISTS but EMPTY (no files generated due to build failure)

## Root Cause
Pre-existing issue: Convex backend not initialized
- Missing: convex/_generated/api
- File affected: src/components/forms/LeadForm.tsx

## Action Required
- This is a KNOWN ISSUE documented in inherited wisdom
- Requires Convex initialization: `npx convex dev` or `npx convex deploy`
- This will generate the missing convex/_generated/api file

## Conclusion
Build verification task COMPLETE (verification done, errors documented)
Build itself FAILED due to pre-existing Convex dependency issue
