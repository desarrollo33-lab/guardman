=== Task 0.1 - SSR Configuration Change ===
Date: Mon Feb 16 18:56:54 PSADT 2026

Change made: output: 'static' -> output: 'server'
File: astro.config.mjs line 10

Build output shows SSR is configured:
  [build] output: "server"
  [build] mode: "server"
  [build] adapter: @astrojs/vercel

PRE-EXISTING ISSUE: Build fails due to missing convex/_generated/api
This is NOT related to SSR change - Convex not initialized
