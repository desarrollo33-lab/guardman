  team_members: defineTable({
  company_values: defineTable({
  process_steps: defineTable({
  stats: defineTable({
  industries: defineTable({
  ctas: defineTable({

New tables added (8):
  - heroes (with index by_page_slug)
  - team_members (with index by_order)
  - company_values (with index by_order)
  - process_steps (with index by_page_slug)
  - stats (with index by_page_slug)
  - industries (with indexes by_slug, by_order)
  - ctas (with index by_page_slug)

All tables use proper v.* validators (no v.any())
Existing tables preserved (no removals)
